# Discography YAML v.01

# NOTES:
#   - This is a proposed YAML implementation for importing/exporting discographies.
#   - Background: http://drupal.org/node/1226226
#   - How this information is parsed and displayed is dependent on the
#     application that imports/exports it. 

# STRUCTURE
#    - Channel info: The first level items describe the discography itself, similar to
#      RSS channel level info. Title, Publish date, URL, Image, Author, Description.
#    - RELEASES is an array of items. Each item can either be a single track entity
#      or an album entity containing an array of tracks. Your discography should
#      be structured in such a way that you only have to define things once, and that
#      nesting and track order are implied. We want to avoid overengineered semantics,
#      data redundancy and circuitious node referencing when possible to keep
#      things human readable.

# TODOS:
#   - Check YAML formatting / compliance. Minimize indenting?
#   - Clarify what minimum fields are required to make this useful:
#     i.e. Every release needs a Title & URI
